Release Notes

- V2:
  In order to use our Qt-based program, please download and extract the released bundle as a whole.
  After doing so, simply run RestaurantUISimulator.exe on a Windows PC.
  The release bundle will include the necessary files to function cleanly on Windows, but not Linux or MacOS.
